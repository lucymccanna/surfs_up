Module 9 - SQLite

## Overview
#### Purpose

In this module, precipitation and weather data was analyzed from 9 weather stations in Oahu, Hawaii. The weather data was analyzed and prepared for submission to potential investors for a local Surf 'n Shake shop. 

## Results

* The data collected shows that the average temperature in June in Oahu is 74.9 degrees and in December is 71.0 degrees, with a standard deviation of 3.3 and 3.7, respectively. 

* The maximum temperature in December is 83 degrees, whereas the maximum temperature in June is 85 degrees. 

* The minimum temperatures in June and December are 64 and 56 degrees, respectively.


## Summary

The temperatures in Oahu are relatively consistent year round, suggesting that a Surf 'n Shake shop would be successful throughout all months of the year. 

To gather more insight into the Oahu weather patterns, two additional queries were performed to compare precipitation in June vs December. In June, the average precipitation is 0.13 with a standard deviation of 0.33, whereas the average precipitation in December was 0.22 with a standard deviation of 0.54. Overall, as seen in the figures below, the rainfall is very similar in the months of June and December, and the level of precipitation should not have much effect on the business.
